# Information Gathering
This repository documents an information-gathering practical performed on Kali Linux. It includes explanations of tools, example commands, and suggested next steps. Only test systems you have authorization to test.

## What is information gathering?

Information gathering is the very first and most critical step of every penetration test.

It does not matter if you have to assess the security of an entire network or a single web application, you need to know your targets in as much detail as possible.

**‚≠ê Tools used for information gathering**

Tools: whois, Netcraft, nslookup, nc (netcat), whatweb.

### Whois lookup

Whois lookup is a tool that helps you find details about a domain name, like who owns it, when it was registered, and which company manages it. It‚Äôs useful for getting basic information about a website during the information-gathering part of security testing.

Using whois on Kali Linux:

<img width="767" height="434" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 083554" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1007ce19-4f27-467c-b2ed-6a86ac77492c" />

The `whois google.com` command is used to gather registration details about the domain `google.com`.

Domain Name: The domain you searched (in this case, GOOGLE.COM).

Registrar: The company that manages the domain registration (MarkMonitor Inc.).

Creation and Expiry Dates: When the domain was created (1997-09-15) and when it will expire (2028-09-14).

Updated Date: When the domain record was last modified.

Name Servers: The DNS servers that handle domain queries (NS1.GOOGLE.COM, NS2.GOOGLE.COM, etc.).

Domain Status: Lists restrictions applied to the domain, such as preventing unauthorized transfers or deletions.

Registrar Contact Info: Includes an abuse contact email and phone number.

This information helps identify who registered the domain, how long it has been active, and which DNS servers are in use ‚Äî all useful during the information-gathering phase of security testing.

Instead of using command-line tools, you can also use web-based tools such as whois.domaintools.com.

We can also obtain the IP address of a machine belonging to the organization under investigation.

This Whois information confirms that google.com is officially owned and managed by Google LLC through the registrar MarkMonitor. The record includes key administrative details such as creation and expiry dates, domain protection settings, and DNS server configuration ‚Äî all valuable during the information-gathering phase to verify authenticity and ownership of a domain.

### Using Netcraft


Netcraft is a great alternative to the process previously illustrated.

### nslookup

Nslookup is another very handy tool that lets you translate hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa.

<img width="307" height="182" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 121147" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e37a350-6568-4a7c-9bc1-d8390f6f6ebc" />

The nslookup command queries the DNS to find the IP addresses associated with a domain.

Server: 10.128.253.185 ‚Äî the DNS server used for the query.

Non-authoritative answer: Shows the IP addresses of google.com

IPv4: 172.217.24.238 ‚Äî one of the resolved IPv4 addresses for google.com.

IPv6: 2404:6800:4002:816::200e

This means google.com can be reached at these IP addresses.

**üëâReverse DNS Lookup (PTR)**

<img width="555" height="219" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 121908" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77f0da30-2279-4bc5-8e9c-a49bf6c2cc33" />

Using nslookup -type=PTR 172.217.24.238 queries DNS to find PTR records (domain names) associated with an IP address.

Non-authoritative answer: Lists several hostnames for the IP 172.217.24.238, such as:

kul06s17-in-f238.1e100.net

hkg12s34-in-f14.1e100.net

tzdela-bb-in-f14.1e100.net

del03s05-in-f14.1e100.net

This shows that reverse DNS (PTR) lookups can return multiple hostnames for a single IP, especially for large services like Google.

**üëâNameserver (NS) lookup**

<img width="452" height="336" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 122110" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2be9e1d3-61a8-4fa9-a9da-a44f2ab60d38" />

This command lists the authoritative DNS servers for google.com.
Output shows four nameservers: ns1.google.com, ns2.google.com, ns3.google.com, ns4.google.com.
The authoritative section also returns their IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), e.g. ns1.google.com ‚Üí 216.239.32.10 and 2001:4860:4802:32::a.

Meaning: NS records tell you which DNS servers are responsible for the domain. The presence of multiple NS entries provides redundancy ‚Äî if one DNS server fails, others can respond.

### nc (netcat)

nc (netcat): A lightweight command-line utility for reading from and writing to network connections. It can open TCP/UDP ports, act as a simple client or server, transfer files, and test services ‚Äî often described as the ‚ÄúSwiss Army knife‚Äù of networking.

<img width="391" height="326" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 144413" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eafe2ed2-8cc4-4324-9090-398cbe6877a9" />


"no port[s] to connect to" ‚Äî nc usually requires a port (e.g., nc 172.217.26.110 80).

Despite that, a HTTP exchange occurred and server-like responses were returned. The output shows two different HTTP responses:

A 200 OK header block (includes Content-Length, Content-Type, Last-Modified) ‚Äî this looks like a cached/initial header response.

Followed by 403 Forbidden with Cache-Control: no-cache and a short body ‚Äî the final response indicates access to the requested resource was denied.

Client-Peer: 5.22.145.121:80 ‚Äî this indicates the remote peer that responded; do not assume it is always an intermediate proxy without further evidence.

Timestamps (Client-Date, Last-Modified) are in GMT and show when the server generated those headers.

### WhatWeb

WhatWeb: A command-line web scanner that identifies web technologies (servers, frameworks, CMS, headers, cookies, and more) used by a website.

<img width="1906" height="131" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-06 145033" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37185608-988b-4a8e-ad3c-ca1b366fc93a" />

whatweb https://google.com 

The site https://google.com`
 responds with 301 Moved Permanently and redirects to https://www.google.com/.`
 
The redirect response includes uncommon headers like content-security-policy-report-only (CSP in report-only mode) and alt-svc (advertises alternate services/protocols).

The final URL https://www.google.com/`
 returns 200 OK, serves HTML5, and is served by gws (Google Web Server).`
 
Cookies observed: AEC and NID (both marked HttpOnly, so not accessible to JavaScript).

Security headers: X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN(prevents framing) and X-XSS-Protection: 0 (deprecated; modern sites rely on CSP).

Other notes: accept-ch header present (client hint declarations) and Script detected (site serves JavaScript). IP addresses shown are Google IPs.

Takeaway: Google redirects google.com ‚Üí www.google.com, serves a modern HTML5 site with CSP in report-only mode, has HttpOnly cookies, and uses common anti-framing protections.

`whatweb -v http://google.com` ‚Äî this command is used for web reconnaissance; it identifies technologies and configurations used by a website.

1. Initial Response (301 Redirect)

Status: 301 Moved Permanently ‚Äî means http://google.com`
 redirects to http://www.google.com/.`
 
RedirectLocation: http://www.google.com/
That‚Äôs the new URL.

Server: gws
Google Web Server ‚Äî Google‚Äôs own web server software.

Security Headers:

X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN ‚Üí Prevents clickjacking by not allowing the page to load in an iframe from another domain.

X-XSS-Protection: 0 ‚Üí Disables browser‚Äôs built-in XSS protection (Google uses its own advanced systems instead).

Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only ‚Üí A policy for testing what kind of scripts/content can load (used to detect vulnerabilities).

2. After Redirection (http://www.google.com/)

Status: 200 OK ‚Üí The page loaded successfully.

Title: Google

IP: 142.250.194.36

Country: United States

- `Server: gws`
- `Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1`
- `Cache-Control: private, max-age=0`
- `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: ...`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 0`
